Weather Tracker — Personal TODO
================================

[ ] Add support for hourly data (currently daily only)
[ ] Build a simple CLI menu for filtering by station
[ ] Add wind chill calculation for winter readings
[ ] Export summary as JSON file (not just print)
[ ] Try using matplotlib for temperature graphs
[ ] Ask Claude Code to help refactor summarize() into smaller functions

Random notes:
- The CSV format works fine for now, might switch to SQLite later
- WS-002 seems to have higher wind speeds — check if it's coastal
- Remember: config.json has the API key in it, don't share publicly!
- Meeting with team on Friday about adding real-time data feeds
