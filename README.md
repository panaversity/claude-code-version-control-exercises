## How to Get Started

### With Claude Code (Terminal) — Recommended

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the exercise folder: `cd module-1-repo-foundations/exercise-1.1-project-kickoff/`
3. Read the instructions: `cat INSTRUCTIONS.md`
4. Start Claude Code and work through the exercise
5. Use Git commands directly in the terminal

## Recommended Order

Work through one module per session. Each module has two exercises:
- **X.1 (Build)** — Create something from scratch. Do this first.
- **X.2 (Debug)** — Fix something broken. Apply what you learned in X.1.

| Session | Module | Time Estimate |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Module 1: Repository Foundations | 60-90 min |
| 2 | Module 2: Change Tracking & Recovery | 60-90 min |
| 3 | Module 3: Branch Strategies | 60-90 min |
| 4 | Module 4: GitHub & Remote Workflows | 60-90 min |
| 5 | Module 5: Pull Requests & Code Review | 60-90 min |
| 6 | Module 6: Workflow Documentation | 60-90 min |
| 7 | Module 7: Capstone (pick one) | 2-4 hours |

## The Git Safety Framework

Use this mental checklist for every exercise:

1. **Assess** — What's the current state? (`git status`, `git log`, `git branch`)
2. **Plan** — What needs to happen? What's the safest path?
3. **Protect** — Create a safety net before risky changes (commit, branch, backup)
4. **Execute** — Run the commands with intention
5. **Verify** — Did it work? Check status, diff, log
6. **Document** — Record what happened and why (commit messages, workflow docs)

## Prerequisites

- Git installed (`git --version`)
- Python 3.10+ installed (`python --version`)
- GitHub account (for Modules 4-5 and Capstones B-C)
- GitHub CLI recommended (`gh --version`)
- Claude Code access

## Important Notes

- All API keys and secrets in these exercises are FAKE. They use the pattern `FAKE-*-for-exercise`.
- Setup scripts (`setup.sh`) create isolated Git repositories. They won't affect your other work.
- Each exercise is self-contained. You can skip ahead if you already know a topic.
- The capstones integrate all skills — attempt them only after completing Modules 1-6.
