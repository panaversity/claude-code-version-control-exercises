## Reviewer Comments (Simulated)

> **senior-dev**: "What does this PR do? 47 files is a LOT of changes. I can't review this without understanding the scope."

> **tech-lead**: "This needs to be broken into smaller PRs. I see changes to the auth system, the database schema, AND the UI all in one PR. Each should be separate."

> **teammate**: "Is there a reason you changed the logging format? That's going to break our log aggregation."
