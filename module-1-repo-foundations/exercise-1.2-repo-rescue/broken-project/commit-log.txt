This file shows the commit history of the broken project.
Students should study these to understand what BAD commit messages look like.

Simulated `git log --oneline` output:
=========================================

a3f8c21  done
b7e2d14  wip
c91a4b6  update
d5f3e78  asdf
e2c9a01  stuff
f8d1b34  fix

=========================================

Notes:
- Every single commit message is meaningless
- Impossible to tell what changed or why
- If something broke, you'd have no idea which commit to revert
- Compare with GOOD commit messages like:
    "Add inventory backup before destructive operations"
    "Fix currency formatting for values over $1000"
    "Remove hardcoded file path, use config instead"
